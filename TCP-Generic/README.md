This program is not part of Lab Practicals

This program is developed for running any command from client to server and not just 'ls'. It supports every commands and works as remote terminal.

to use this one needs to understand following commands:
typing 'cm-text' will change mode of client and server to text mode
lly, 'cm-cmd' to Terminal command mode
lly, 'cm-ftp' for filetransfer mode

So there are three modes:
1.)text-> It is just for sending message from client to server.
2.)cmd->client can send any command to server and can see the output in it's console
3.)ftp-> it is file downloading mode where client can send filename and will recieve file from server
NOTE: Type "exit" to exit from client and server
